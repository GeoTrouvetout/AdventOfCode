Repo-blog of ma attempts to complete the famous Advent Of Code competition https://adventofcode.com/

# context of play

I play the game as follows:
  - I log the start time by hand (it's not precise, I have a needle watch and I'm not good at reading it)
  - I wrote code until a get the answer right
  - I log the end time (again quite roughly)
  - I comment my code to explain wtf happened


# Code-log state

This repo is a code-log: 

It reports the exact state of the codes that I wrote when I reach 2 stars for each day. 
Here, no impressive optimization, no look-at-my-code, no outsmarting attempt: just a log of how a everyday coder code.

=> Please don't judge me
